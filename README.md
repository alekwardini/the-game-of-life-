My CS Project: The Game of Life
I built this project for my Computer Science class. I first got interested in the Game of Life after watching videos about it online. It’s crazy how such a simple set of rules can create things as complex as logic gates and even entire computers. This project was my attempt to build that system from scratch and see how those patterns actually work.

What I learned
Working on this was a great way to practice math and logic. I had to figure out:

Pattern Recognition: Seeing how cells live or die based on their neighbors helped me get better at spotting patterns in data.

Math Logic: I had to do a lot of coordinate math to make sure clicking the screen accurately placed a block on the grid, in addition to that the game was orrignally made by a maths teacher so tinkering aroud with it probably helped me gain an extra iq points for maths 

Problem Solving: It was a challenge to get the "Generation" logic to run smoothly without breaking the interface, which taught me a lot about how to structure a program.

How it works
I wanted the game to be interactive so I could experiment with different shapes:

The Grid: You can click anywhere to draw or clcik another on a living cell to delete 

The Buttons:

Green: starts the simulation so you can watch the cells evolve.

Red: stops the simulation so you can edit into whatever you like

Blue: wipes the whole screen so you can start over.

Setting it up
Make sure you have Pygame installed.

Run interface.py to open the window.
